# AUTOMATIC RAIN PREDICTION DASHBOARD 

This project was specifically aimed to build a Machine Learning model to predict rainfall occurrences using upper air data from the University of Wyoming's Atmosphere Lability Index. 

Additional data was taken from the BMKG aviation meteorology API regarding the rain occurrence, which reported on half-hourly intervals by the regional meteorological station studied at Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport Makassar. 

This repo is for dashboard only.
